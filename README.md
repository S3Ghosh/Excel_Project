## Problem Statement
Atliq Hardware is a company that sells hardware components like PC, mouse, printers etc. to different customers like Staples, Flipkart and from there they will sell the products to the end consumer. The market is changing rapidly and the sales director of the company is facing a lot of issues in terms of tracking his sales in the dynamically growing market. He is not getting correct information about the sales from his regional managers so he is unable to get a cleat picture of the sales happening in the company. He wants clear reports of different aspects of his sales like country wise target and the actual performance, how to engage with customers in a better way to increase the sales. In this project we will be solving this problem using Excel.
